# `Quality_Check_Analysis.xlsx`  
This file focuses on evaluating the quality of models or methods using key performance metrics. It includes detailed analyses of accuracy and FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance) across various scenarios or models.

**Tabs**:  
- **Accuracy**:  
This tab contains accuracy metrics to evaluate the similarity between generated images and original ones. The results are for the model (pretrained VGG16) trained on original data and tested on generated images produced by both DDPM and PGGANs.
